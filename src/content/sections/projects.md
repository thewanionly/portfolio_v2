    description: This project is a solution to Frontend Mentor's REST Countries API
      with color theme switcher challenge. This is built with ReactJS with
      TypeScript as primary tech stack. I've adopted a Test-Driven Development
      (TDD) approach in building this project using Jest and React Testing
      Library. This is a responsive application and also has dark mode which
      showcased my css layout and architectural skills. This also involves REST
      API and best practices in fetching data.
